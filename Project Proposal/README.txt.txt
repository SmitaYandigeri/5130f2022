Abstract
In many of the developing countries like India, school students maintain the homework notebook, where students note their homework on daily basis. In such process the students could miss the submissions for not writing their homework properly and may miss the due dates. In addition, there are chances that some kids may not write anything in the homework notebook where parents are not aware of such homework. Such incidents not only affect the student grades but also may lag in academics. With student homework- notifier application we can digitalize the process by allowing the teachers/parents to follow up with students to complete the homework on time without any confusions. The aim of the project is to prepare a website application/android notifier for school students to distribute and notify the homework. The application makes the parents and students to access the homework easily from any place and time which avoids bookkeeping of the homework. Once the teacher posts homework, the parents/students should get the notification about the homework and parents should be able to update the status of the homework back in App. So, this application allows parents to get the notification about their children homework where they can follow up on their kids in getting it completed.

Approach  
Below is the high-level approach: 
1.	Develop a web application where teachers will be able to create a classroom for their subject and parents will be able to join the classroom created by teachers.
2.	Teachers will have the admin rights to invite the students/parents to join the classroom created in step above. 
3.	Teachers will have the right to post the homework in classroom they created in step 1.
4.	Parents can join the classroom from the home page using the invitation code obtained while creating classroom.
5.	Once the homework is posted, the subscribed students/parents will be notified about the homework posting. 
6.	Once the students have completed the work, they can update the status back in same application. 
7.	Teacher can check the overall status of homework submissions.
